# Decision Tree and Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes and Decision Tree algorithm implementations from scratch.
Project 1 is presented on the Deep_Learning_Project_1.pdf file and the implementation of the code is presented on DecisionTree&NaiveBayes.ipynb.
Both algorithms are compared on 4 datasets (Experimental.ipnyb).

Datasets:
  - Iris Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris
  - Muhsrooms Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification
  - HR Dataset
  - Banknotes Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivekgediya/banknote-authenticationcsv
